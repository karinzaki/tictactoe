## :mag_right: My experience
- Used pseudocode to plan the project aims and actions
- Researched other tic tac toe games to see layouts, functions and user experience
- Developed a skeleton code that then rooted into the more detailed codes
- Difficulties I ran into:
  > Removing the click function after a win/tie
  > Grid cells changing sizes on click
  > Creating a reload/reset game function
